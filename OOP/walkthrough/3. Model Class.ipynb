    "- Describes real world entities \n",
    "- Can be directly compared to variabels as it is used to store and pass data \n",
    "- We can create data types and data structures out of model classes \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "- Attributes are the most important part of model classes \n",
    "- Methods are only used to work on the attributes of the class \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uses \n",
    "- We can use them to easily pass data \n",
    "    - Instead of passing multiple variable to every function that wants to perform similar operations, we can use a single class object to pass this information \n",
    "- We can easily deserialize values from csv files and json files and have a bit of type safety \n",
    "    - We know that the application will either crash or create default values if the file has missing data \n",
    "- Custom Data structures\n",
    "    - We can create our own data structures that better model how we want to work with our data if predefined data structures don't meet our needs "
