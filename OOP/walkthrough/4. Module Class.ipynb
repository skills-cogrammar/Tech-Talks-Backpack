    "# Module Class \n",

    "### What is it \n",
    "- A class the performs a series of related operations \n",
    "- Most Python Packages that you use are module classes as they perform specific operations \n",
    "- Allow us to carry operations between different parts of our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation \n",
    "- Methods are the most important part of module classes \n",
    "- Attributes are used to store data that is commonly used between the different methods \n",
    "- Must be stateless \n",
    "    - Any one method call should not affect the next method call \n",
    "    - Every call should give me the same result (depending on the parameters I pass and initialization of the object)\n",
    "- Should only take in parameters and return results \n",
    "    - No print statements \n",
    "    - No input functions \n",
    "\n",
    "### Uses \n",
    "- Allows us to write code once, and use it in different places \n",
    "    - We can use the same code within a single codebase \n",
    "    - We can take the module and us it in different projects \n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits \n",
    "- When using abstraction, allows use to change the module we are working with without haveing to change any of the implementation code.\n",
    "- Allows for easier code reuse\n"

Module classes allow us to break up the concerns of our code better and they make code reuse a lot easier to do.\n",
